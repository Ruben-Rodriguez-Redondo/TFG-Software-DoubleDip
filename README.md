# Extended and Improved Implementation of Double-DIP  

This project is an extended and refined fork of the official implementation of the paper  
[*"Double-DIP: Unsupervised Image Decomposition via Coupled Deep-Image-Priors"*](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/DoubleDIP/resources/DoubleDIP.pdf),  
originally available [here](https://github.com/yossigandelsman/DoubleDIP/tree/master). Which allow performs tasks as
image segmentation, watermark removal, transparency separation and dehazing, all of them using **unsupervised techniques**.

## ðŸš€ Enhancements in this version  
- âœ… **Code cleanup and refactoring** for better readability and maintainability.  
- âœ… **Extensive comments** to enhance understanding.  
- âœ… **A user-friendly Gradio interface** for easier interaction.  
- âœ… **Additional functionality**:  
  - ðŸ”¹ Including hint creation in **Image segmentation**
  - ðŸ”¹ **Dehazing** extended to videos
